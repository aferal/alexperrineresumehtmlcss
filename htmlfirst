I am a senior in CMU’s online and extended studies program, with a major in Cybersecurity. I currently have earned a 3.4 GPA. I have recently taken a position as Level I Help Desk at ISPN - where I am responsible for networking troubleshooting for ISP's all over the country. I have over 15 years combined Customer Service experience in various settings; plus, finance, fundraising, collections and administrative experience. I am currently studying for my first AWS Certification (AWS CCP.) I am curious, teachable, disciplined and motivated.
